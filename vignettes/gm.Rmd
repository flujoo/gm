```{r message = FALSE}
library(gm)
```

There are two interpretations of the package name *gm*:

1. grammar of music
2. generate music

They correspond to two functionalities of the package:

1. a language for music representation
2. generation of music scores and audio files

Let's start with a quick example.


## Example

```{r}
music <- 
  Music() +
  Meter(4, 4) +
  Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5"))
  
show(music)
```

Let's go through the code line by line:

1. `music <-` defines a variable.
2. `Music()` initializes a `Music` object.
3. `+ Meter(4, 4)` adds a 4/4 time signature.
4. `+ Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5"))` adds four notes.
5. `show(music)` generates the music.

We don’t have to stop here. We can add more components. For example, add a tempo:

```{r}
music <- music + Tempo(180)
show(music)
```

Add an articulation:

```{r}
music <- music + Articulation(">", 1)
show(music)
```

Add a pedal:

```{r}
music <- music + Pedal(1, 4)
show(music)
```

There are still many other components we can add. Before we dive in, let's see how to install and configure gm.


## Installation

Install gm:

```r
install.packages("gm")
```

Install [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/). MuseScore is open source
and free notation software. Internally, gm uses MuseScore to generate music. 


## Configuration

You don’t need to configure anything if MuseScore is installed to a [default path](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/4/revert-factory-settings).

Otherwise, please specify the path to the MuseScore executable file in .Renviron file:

1. Open .Renviron file.
2. Add environment variable `MUSESCORE_PATH=<path to MuseScore>`.
3. Restart R session.

For example, the environment variable is like

- `MUSESCORE_PATH=C:/Program Files/MuseScore 4/bin/MuseScore4.exe` in Windows, and
- `MUSESCORE_PATH=/Applications/MuseScore\ 4.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore` in macOS.


## Music

At the highest level, gm uses `Music` objects to represent music.

As shown in the *Example* section, the workflow for creating music is usually like this:

1. Initialize a `Music` object with `Music()`.
2. Add components to it with `+`.
3. Display the music with `show()`.

A `Music` object is represented as a list of data frames. Each data frame represents some type of components of the music. To examine a `Music` object's representation, simply print it. For example, below is the representation of the `Music` object created in the *Example* section:

```{r}
music <- 
  Music() +
  Meter(4, 4) +
  Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5"))
  
show(music)
```

```{r}
music
```

We will explore every type of components as we proceed.


## Musical Line

Musical lines are the most basic units of music in gm. You can create a musical line with `Line()`.

### Pitches and Durations

You can specify the pitches and durations of a musical line with arguments `pitches` and `durations`. For example:

```{r}
line <- Line(
  pitches = c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5"),
  durations = c(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2)
)

music <- Music() + Meter(5, 4) + line
show(music)
```

If `pitches` and `durations` have different lengths, the shorter one will be recycled. This feature is useful for repeating a pattern. For example:

```{r}
line <- Line(
  pitches = c("A3", "E4", "C5", "B3", "E4", "G#4"),
  durations = c("quarter.", "eighth", "quarter")
)

music <- Music() + Meter(3, 4) + line
show(music)
```

We will talk more about pitches and durations later.

### Musical Line Insertion

You can insert a musical line at positions other than the first beat of the first bar with arguments `bar` and `offset`. For example:

```{r}
line <- Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5"), bar = 2, offset = 1)
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + line
show(music)
```

The musical line is inserted at the second beat of the second bar.

### Multiple Musical Lines

Music can contain more than one musical line. For example:

```{r}
line_1 <- Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5"))
line_2 <- Line(c("E4", "G4"), 2)
line_3 <- Line("C4", 4)
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + line_1 + line_2 + line_3
show(music)
```

You can assign a name to a musical line with argument `name`. For example:

```{r}
line_1 <- Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5"), name = "a")
line_2 <- Line(c("E4", "G4"), 2, name = "b")
line_3 <- Line("C4", 4, name = "c")
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + line_1 + line_2 + line_3
show(music)
```

By default, a musical line is added to the end. You can change it with argument `to` and `after`. For example:

```{r}
line_1 <- Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5"), name = "a")
line_2 <- Line(c("E4", "G4"), 2, name = "b")
line_3 <- Line("C4", 4, name = "c", to = "a", after = FALSE)
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + line_1 + line_2 + line_3
show(music)
```

Now the third musical line is added to the beginning.

### Musical Line Hierarchy

There is a hierarchy of musical lines:

1. part
2. staff
3. voice
4. segment

From the perspective of a music score,

- a part can have several staffs;
- a staff can have up to four voices;
- a voice can have several segments.

You can specify the hierarchy with argument `as`. For example, the following music has two parts:

```{r}
music <- 
  Music() +
  Meter(4, 4) +
  Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5")) +
  Line(c("C4", "G4"), 2, as = "part")

show(music)
```

The following music has one part, and this part has two staffs:

```{r}
music <- 
  Music() +
  Meter(4, 4) +
  Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5")) +
  Line(c("C4", "G4"), 2, as = "staff")

show(music)
```

The following music has one part of one staff, and this staff has two voices:

```{r}
music <- 
  Music() +
  Meter(4, 4) +
  Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5")) +
  Line(c("C4", "G4"), 2, as = "voice")

show(music)
```

Actually, the three examples above all sound the same. The hierarchy of musical lines is only discernible from the score.

The following music has one part of one staff of one voice, and this voice has two segments:

```{r}
music <- 
  Music() +
  Meter(4, 4) +
  Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5")) +
  Line(c("C4", "G4"), 2, as = "segment", bar = 2)

show(music)
```

Segments are used to insert musical lines into other musical lines.

### Musical Line Representation

The `$lines` data frame of a `Music` object contains the information about all musical lines. For example:

```{r}
line_1 <- Line(c("C5", "D5", "E5", "F5"), name = "a")
line_2 <- Line(c("E4", "G4"), 2, name = "b", as = "voice")
line_3 <- Line("C4", 2, name = "c", as = "staff", offset = 2)
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + line_1 + line_2 + line_3
show(music)
```

```{r}
music$lines
```

We can see from the data frame that this music has one part, and this part has two staffs. The first staff has two voices. The second staff is inserted at the third beat.


## Pitch

### Pitch Notation

You can use [scientific pitch notations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation) to specify pitches. For example:

```{r}
pitches <- c("C4", "C#4", "D-4", "C##4", "D--4")
music <- Music() + Meter(5, 4) + Line(pitches)
show(music)
```

A pitch notation consists of

1. a tone name which can be C, D, E, F, G, A, or B,
2. an optional accidental which can be \-, \-\-, \#, or \#\#, and
3. a number between 0 and 9 that indicates the pitch's octave.

### MIDI Note Number

A MIDI note number is a number between 12 and 127. You can also use MIDI note numbers to specify pitches. For example:

```{r}
pitches <- 61:64
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + Line(pitches)
show(music)
```

See a [conversion table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation#Table_of_note_frequencies) of pitch notations and MIDI note numbers.

An advantage of MIDI note numbers is ease of operation. Suppose we have the following four MIDI note numbers:

```{r}
pitches <- c(60, 62, 64, 65)
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + Line(pitches)
show(music)
```

To transpose them up by a fifth, we can simply add 7 to them:

```{r}
pitches <- pitches + 7
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + Line(pitches)
show(music)
```

However, a disadvantage of MIDI note numbers is ambiguity. For example, there is more than one equivalent pitch notation to the MIDI note number 73:

```{r}
pitches <- c("C#5", "D-5", "B##4")
music <- Music() + Meter(3, 4) + Line(pitches)
show(music)
```

gm interprets MIDI note numbers based on keys and neighbor pitches. In the following example, MIDI note number 73 is interpreted as C#5 in the first measure, but as D-5 in the second measure:

```{r}
pitches <- c(73, 73)
music <- Music() + Meter(1, 4) + Key(7) + Key(-7, bar = 2) + Line(pitches)
show(music)
```

### Rest

You can use `NA` to specify rests. For example:

```{r}
pitches <- c("C4", NA, "D4", NA)
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + Line(pitches)
show(music)
```

Sometimes rests are added by gm automatically. In the following example, the musical line is inserted at the second bar, so a rest is added to the first bar:

```{r}
pitches <- c("C4", NA, "D4", NA)
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + Line(pitches, bar = 2)
show(music)
```

In the following example, the musical line doesn’t fill the entire bar, so some rests are added to the end:

```{r}
pitches <- "C4"
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + Line(pitches)
show(music)
```

### Chord

You can use vectors to specify chords. Just remember to wrap them in a list. For example:

```{r}
pitches <- list("C4", c("E4", "G4"), NA, c(64, 67))
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + Line(pitches)
show(music)
```


## Rhythm

### Duration Notation

You can use duration notations to specify durations. For example:

```{r}
durations <- c("q.", "eighth", "quarter..", "16th")
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + Line(durations = durations)
show(music)
```

A duration notation can have two parts:

- a duration type or its abbreviation
- zero to four dots

All supported duration types:

```{r echo = FALSE}
duration_types <- gm:::duration_types

duration_types$value <- duration_types$value |>
  lapply(gm:::to_fraction) |>
  lapply(\(fraction) {
    if (fraction[2] == 1) fraction[1] else paste(fraction, collapse = "/")
  }) |>
  as.character()

names(duration_types) <- c("Duration Type", "Abbreviation", "Value")
knitr::kable(duration_types)
```

### Duration Value

You can also use duration values to specify durations. For example:

```{r}
durations <- 1:5
music <- Music() + Meter(5, 4) + Line("C4", durations)
show(music)
```

A valid duration value should be equal to the total length of one or more duration types. For example, 0.5 is equal to the length of eighth; 1.5 is equal to the total length of quarter and eighth; 1.1 is not valid.

### Tuplet

You can specify tuplets with more complex duration notations. For example:

```{r}
durations <- rep("half/3", 3)
music <- Music() + Meter(2, 4) + Line(durations = durations)
show(music)
```

Here we use "/3" to divide the half note into three tuplets. In the following example, we divide the half note into two tuplets of different lengths:

```{r}
durations <- c("half/3", "half/3*(half/quarter)")
music <- Music() + Meter(2, 4) + Line(durations = durations)
show(music)
```

Please note that tuplets should come in groups. For example, two half/3 tuplets or four half/3 tuplets cannot form a valid group. And a tuplet group should not cross bar lines.

gm can represent nested tuplets like this:

![](../man/figures/nested_tuplets.png)

However, because gm uses MusicXML to represent music internally, but MuseScore cannot handle nested tuplets with MusicXML, we will skip this part.

## Note

### Note Representation

In `Line()`, we don't provide notes, rests, or chords directly. Instead, we separate the pitches and durations. This feature is convenient for music programming.

However, `Music` objects have a data frame `$notes` for representing notes. For example:

```{r}
music <-
  Music() +
  Meter(4, 4) +
  Line(list("C4", NA, c("C4", "E4")), list(1, "quarter", 2))

show(music)
```

```{r}
music$notes
```

The meaning of each column:

- `line` indicates the row number of the musical line a note belongs to.
- `i` indicates a note's index in the musical line.
- `j` indicates a note's index in a chord.
- `pitch` indicates the pitch notation of a note.
- `midi` indicates the MIDI note number of a note.
- `duration` indicates the duration notation of a note.
- `length` indicates the length of a note's duration.

### Tie

You can tie together two notes with `Tie()`. For example:

```{r}
notes <- Line(c("C4", "C4"))
tie <- Tie(1)
music <- Music() + Meter(2, 4) + notes + tie
show(music)
```

You can tie together some notes in chords or the whole chords. For example:

```{r}
chords <- Line(list(c("C4", "E4"), c("C4", "E4")))
tie <- Tie(1, 2)
music <- Music() + Meter(2, 4) + chords + tie
show(music)
```

```{r}
chords <- Line(list(c("C4", "E4"), c("C4", "E4")))
tie <- Tie(1)
music <- Music() + Meter(2, 4) + chords + tie
show(music)
```

gm automatically splits cross-bar notes and adds ties. For example:

```{r}
cross_bar_note <- Line("C4", 4)
music <- Music() + Meter(1, 4) + cross_bar_note
show(music)
```

### Grace Note

You can add grace notes with `Grace()`. For example:

```{r}
line <- Line(c("A3", "B3", "C4", "D4"), c(0.25, 0.25, 1, 1))
music <- Music() + Meter(2, 4) + line + Grace(1) + Grace(2)
show(music)
```

The first two notes are indicated as grace notes.

### Accidental

gm adds accidentals to notes based on the key. You can change default accidentals with `Accidental()`. For example:

```{r}
accidental <- Accidental("natural", 2)
music <- Music() + Meter(2, 4) + Line(c("C4", "C4")) + accidental
show(music)
```

### Notehead

You can change the shape or color of a note with `Notehead()`. For example:

```{r}
notehead <- Notehead(1, shape = "diamond", color = "#FF0000")
music <- Music() + Meter(2, 4) + Line(c("C4", "C4")) + notehead
show(music)
```

### Stem

You can change the stem of a note with `Stem()`. For example:

```{r}
stem <- Stem("none", 1)
music <- Music() + Meter(2, 4) + Line(c("C4", "C4")) + stem
show(music)
```

### Articulation

You can add an articulation to a note with `Articulation()`. Some examples:

```{r}
music <- 
  Music() +
  Meter(4, 4) +
  Line(c("C4", "D4", "E4", "F4")) +
  Articulation(">", 1) +
  Articulation(".", 2) +
  Articulation("'", 3) +
  Articulation("-", 4)
  
show(music)
```

All supported articulations:

```{r echo = FALSE}
articulations <- gm:::articulations
names(articulations) <- c("MuseScore", "MusicXML", "Symbol")
knitr::kable(articulations)
```

### Fermata

You can add a fermata to a note with `Fermata()`. For example:

```{r}
music <- 
  Music() +
  Meter(4, 4) +
  Line(c("C4", "D4", "E4", "F4")) +
  Fermata(4, shape = "square")
  
show(music)
```

### Breath Mark

You can add a breath mark to a note with `Breath()`. For example:

```{r}
music <- 
  Music() +
  Meter(4, 4) +
  Line(c("C4", "D4", "E4", "F4")) +
  Breath(2)
  
show(music)
```

### Ornament

You can add an ornament to a note with the following options:

- `Schleifer()`
- `Mordent()`
- `Trill()`
- `Turn()`
- `Tremolo()`

Some examples:

```{r}
music <- 
  Music() +
  Meter(7, 4) +
  Line(c("B4", "C5", "D5", "E5", "F5", "G5", "A5")) +
  Tremolo(3, 1) +
  Turn(2, inverted = TRUE) +
  Mordent(3, long = TRUE) + 
  Trill(4) + 
  Trill(5, 6) +
  Schleifer(7)

show(music)
```

### Slur

You can add a slur to notes with `Slur()`. For example:

```{r}
music <- Music() + Meter(4, 4) + Line(60:63) + Slur(1, 4)
show(music)
```

Slurs can cross staffs. For example:

```{r}
music <- 
  Music() +
  Meter(4, 4) +
  Line(c("C4", "D4")) +
  Line(c("E4", "F4"), offset = 2, as = "staff") +
  Slur(1, 2, to = 1, to_j = 2)

show(music)
```
